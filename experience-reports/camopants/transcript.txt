Dicekeys beta


Name: Gulraj Rijhwani (alias camopants)


Notice received of confirmation for the Beta, 2020-09-15.  UK delivery expected by 2020-09-29.  Delivery badly delayed by having to pay import duty and handling charge because the package wasn't marked as a testing sample.

For general thoughts and experience of setting the dice there is the audio recording.

The general experience of the product is OK, though the scanner app wasn't working on iPhone 7 (iOs 14) under either Safari or DDG browser.  The app on a Linux laptop worked fine.

Final assembly of the frame with lid into the box worked well.  I do think some mechanism should be available for opening and re-setting the key by choice.  Overall a good experience.
